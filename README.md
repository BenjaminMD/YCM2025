### Abstract

We present a TDS modeling and fitting approach that represents **correlated** atomic motion via joint atomic displacement parameters (J-ADPs). Given a crystal’s dynamical matrix—derived from DFT, elastic-constant approximations, or universal potentials—**YELL** computes large 3D TDS volumes using FFTs in all phonons. This avoids truncation to one- or two-phonon terms and enables fast, whole-detector fits. The J-ADP formulation yields real-space correlation tensors that can be compared across temperatures and materials, and integrates with the **3D-ΔPDF** suite to extract elastic constants. Applications include quantifying high-amplitude soft modes relevant to negative-thermal-expansion systems such as **ScF₃**.
